# Big App Development

## Modules and Large App Development

If you develop a large app, it has sense to split it into multiple modules, which can be developed and tested separately and combined into a single app on the last step of development.

Webix Jet toolchain has been updated to support such kind of development (Starting with Webix Jet 1.5). For new projects, just use the [jet-start](https://github.com/webix-hub/jet-start) pack. To update existing projects, check **webpack.config.js** against the [latest one](https://github.com/webix-hub/jet-start/blob/master/webpack.config.js) and update the **scripts** section in [package.json](https://github.com/webix-hub/jet-start/blob/master/package.json).

CLI commands:

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm run module` or `yarn module` | builds a standalone module, which is stored in **dist/module/** \(a JS and a CSS files\); the module **doesn't** include _webix-jet_ |
| `npm run standalone` or `yarn standalone` | builds a standalone module, which is stored in **dist/full/** \(a JS and a CSS files\); the module **includes all dependencies** |

When the module is built, you can copy it to a subfolder of some other app, e.g. _sources/modules/_.

### When to use _module_

If you want to use the module as a part of another Webix Jet app:

* use _**npm run module**_ or _**yarn module**_
* import the JS and CSS files of your module from the subfolder you have put them into:

```javascript
// views/someview.js
import OtherApp from "modules/app-name";
import "modules/style.css";
...
config(){
    return {
        rows:[
            ToolbarView,
            new OtherApp()
        ]
    };
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to use webix-jet 1.4+
{% endhint %}

Modules are much more lightweight than bundles with dependencies. So if you plan to create a lot of app modules, compile them this way.

### When to use _standalone_

If you want to use the module on a page without Webix Jet:

* use _**npm run standalone**_ or _**yarn standalone**_
* include the JS and CSS files of your module from the subfolder you have put them into:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script src="modules/app-name.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="modules/style.css">
<script>
    webix.ready(function(){
        var app = new appname.default();
        app.render(document.body);
    });
</script>
```

Instead of `document.body` you can use the ID of the target HTML container.

Standalone bundles include all dependencies \(except _webix.js_\), so they are more stable. However, the size of a bundle is much bigger than the size of a module.

## Using Jet App as a Widget

If you want to nest an app module into Webix layout, you should create a custom widget based on **webix.ui.jetapp** and wrap the app into it.

```javascript
// sources/myapp.js
import {JetApp} from "webix-jet";
export default class MyApp extends JetApp {
    //app config
    constructor(){
        const defaults = {
            id     	: APPNAME,
			version	: VERSION,
            router  : BUILD_AS_MODULE ? EmptyRouter : HashRouter, //!
            debug   : !PRODUCTION,
            start   : "/top/start"
        };
        super({ ...defaults, ...config });
    }
}

if (!BUILD_AS_MODULE){
    webix.ready(() => new MyApp().render() );
}

// add this
webix.protoUI({
    name:"some-widget",
    app: MyApp
}, webix.ui.jetapp);
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure the app config includes the EmptyRouter.
{% endhint %}

Now you can run `npm run standalone` or `yarn standalone` to get a standalone bundle. Then you can copy the bundle to any subfolder of your app and use it:

```html
<script src="module/app-name.js"></script>
<script>
    webix.ui({ view:"some-widget" })
</script>
```

This JetApp works as a widget and can be combined and sized like any other Webix UI widget.
